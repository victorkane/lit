## lit.js

An online listerary workshop based on a custom MEAN stack architecture:

* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* AngularJS
* NodeJS

Status: Just getting underway, old 2011 legacy code copied to lit2011legacy and lit2012 branches, master still contains legacy NodeJS/ExpressJS/Couchdb code.

Project tracking docs now on [Trello KanBan Board](https://trello.com/b/yZXlZJCj).

GitHub wiki will be suplanted by Trello KanBan Board and will be left with some process and architectural docs.

A book and supporting videos will be published on the making of lit, for those interested in learning how to build MEAN stack based projects using a modern Lean/Agile process. Details forthcoming.

For a short time, the [legacy README file](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/blob/master/READMElegacy.md) will be kept in this project directory. There are two legacy branches archived in this repo: `lit2012` and `lit2011legacy`
